1.3 (2010-08-13)
  * '...' not passed correctly in 'plot.ci.se' with 'type="bars"' resulting in an error
  * CI is not re-computed by default in 'smooth.roc'. You can still turn it on with 'reuse.ci=TRUE'
  * New function 'are.paired'
  * Local maximas could be incorrectly detected in 'coords' (and 'plot.roc') with 'predictor's containing more than 2 levels.
  * New method 'venkatraman' for 'roc.test'
  * MASS and tcltk packages are now only suggested instead of required

1.2.1 (2010-05-11)
  * Handle 'method' arguments for 'smooth.roc' and 'ci.auc' separately in 'roc.default'
  * Added 'auc.polygon.*' and 'max.auc.polygon.*' arguments for 'polygon' in 'plot.roc'

1.2 (2010-05-09)
  * Added DeLong method in 'ci.auc'
  * Return value of 'ci.auc' does not contain an 'aucs' item anymore
  * Put most examples with bootstrap within '\dontrun{}' blocks for faster (but less useful) checks execution

1.1 (2010-05-05)
  * Added 'lines.roc' functions for ROC
  * Added 'type' argument for both 'lines.roc' and 'plot.roc'
  * Added 'print.auc.col' argument to 'plot.roc'
  * Fixed a warning in 'roc.test.default' when the class of 'predictor1' had several elements
  * Fixed an encoding failure during the checks on MacOS X

1.0.1 (2010-04-28)
  * Reduced examples execution time. Added low 'boot.n' in the slowest examples and 'reuse.auc' and 'reuse.ci' arguments in smooth.roc.roc

1.0 (2010-04-27)
  * First public release
