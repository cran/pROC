  * Added DeLong for CI of AUC
  * Return value of ci.auc does not contain an 'aucs' item anymore.

1.1 (2010-05-05)
  * Added 'lines.roc' functions for ROC
  * Added 'type' argument for both 'lines.roc' and 'plot.roc'
  * Added 'print.auc.col' argument to 'plot.roc'
  * Fixed a warning in 'roc.test.default' when the 'class' of predictor1 had several elements
  * Fixed an encoding failure during the checks on MacOS X

1.0.1 (2010-04-28)
  * Reduced examples execution time. Added low "boot.n" in the slowest examples and "reuse.auc" and "reuse.ci" arguments in smooth.roc.roc.
